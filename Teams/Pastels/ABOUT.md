I am the single human in this team with a set of Pastels. I’ve not been doing anything great all my life but sketching and scribbling with my friends (my pastels). After taking formal Indian education and then a conventional job, I realised that simply earning bread and butter without making an impact is wasting this life. Lately I tried to figure out what was I passionate about? Delivering great user experiences was my thing: using my knowledge to build systems, inclination towards art and my ability to understand people very well by talking with them.
