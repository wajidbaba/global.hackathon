*We Do What We Must Because We Can*

Our team was formed entirely from the community on Koding.com with a diverse mixture of developers providing us with unique and creative perspectives for exploring the challenges presented by the Koding.com themes.


Welcome to the Laboratory!

More about us!
==============
For most (if not all) of us, this is our first hackathon! We want a challenging, competative experience in which we can engage and learn as we work together to meet our project goal in providing a solution to one of the Koding.com themes.

* Eric) A front-end designer and developer with 6+ years of experience (HTML/CSS/JS).
* Super Bear) A back-end developer (PHP, MySQL,Mongo, Redis, some Python, some Shell) using Linux/mac.
* Tim) Full stack developer, 10+ years experience (PHP/MySQL/JS/HTML/CSS). Other experience: Python, c/c++/c#, shell and some java. Tim Turner studies Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Washington in Seattle. If that weren’t enough for a mere mortal, Tim also works at an IT company and runs a web dev shop of his own. He loves to help others bring their ideas to life. More about me: [stories.koding.com/tim-turner](http://stories.koding.com/story/tim-turner/)
* Cyril) Back-end developer (PHP, MySQL, Doctrine, Java)...a Software Architect at CYMAPK, a company that focuses on building web based applications for the Finance industry. While not working, I focus on participating in forums and blogs at Codecall. My main interests are Database modelling and back-end programming...and outside of I.T related stuff i enjoy a good kick-about (football). I am looking foward to this hackathon as both fun, challenging and interactive. Lets do this :)
* Andrew) Java/Python/Ruby Programmer with Rails Experience (2 Years overall exp) (Bonus: High Schooler with a passion for coding!) Owns Liquid Think (.net) where he writes interesting and engaging posts about new things in technology--whether it be Open-Source, Linux, Hacker Culture or Gadgetry. When he's not writing Blog Posts or Code, he's sailing in his Laser Dinghy. He hopes to learn more about interactive Web Applications and Developement in this Hackathon. 


We're going to attack the challenges presented by the hackathon themes, collaborate and develop a creative, unique solution, and produce a useful product to meet the presented need.
