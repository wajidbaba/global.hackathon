I'm Computer Science Graduate (2013), and I like solving problems.

It's not about winning or losing, it's about facing challenges, learning and solving problems.

KeysHit
=======
KeysHit is the name of the challenging, addictvie, typing and memory game I am making. Basically, it helps user exercise concentration and memory, and practice random keys typing.

I myself find it all addictive!
