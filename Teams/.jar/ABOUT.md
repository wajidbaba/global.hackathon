Hello Everyone!  We are a group of programmers from the United States and love all things techy and awesome.  Our initial initials came up with jar (raj would've been cool too I guess) and so we decided to go with that!  We're a friendly bunch from all over the US and through mutual friends, have been able to get together and come up with an awesome idea.  Let's take a look!

Joe is currently studying at Temple University and will be taking care of tying together everyone and everything.  He is an idea guy that manages everyone rather well.  An all around helper. He enjoys rock climbing, video games, and eating. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/joesong)

Alex
=======
Alex is from Cornell and also from California.  He is an interesting guy who enjoys fishing, diving, and wants to own a restaurant when programming isn't what he wants to do anymore.  He's currently working on his own start-up in his free time but makes sure to have enough time to goof around every now and then. [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/alexsngai?fref=ts)

Randy
=======
Randy is originally from Philadelphia but also met Alex at Cornell.  They are best friends and his parents are worried for him (because he may never want to find a wife).  With that being said, Randy is an excellent backend programmer and will be working on the python / nltk backend of things.  He enjoys rock climbing, running, and playing video games.

Nick
=======
Nick is a 20 year old, raised in New Jersey and enjoys everything technology.  He enjoys computer science, system and web design, photography, cinematography, drinking tea, and making lists.  He is a reductionist utilitarian autodidact to the effect of minimalism (which means he is relatively materialistic, but keep to a minimum, love Ockham's razor, hate waste, and is primarily self taught.  He will work on the front end side of things creating a beautiful map for us to see.  [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/reduced.fat.milk)

About Our Project
=======
It's pretty easy to get sick nowadays.  Even with the constant scares going around about this or that contagious disease, people are still contracting illnesses and, in turn, handing it off to people.  The interesting thing is that most people will not turn to their loved ones or to chicken soup first; they will tweet it, facebook it, #sick #cold #flu #etc.  So what can we do about it?  In order to battle the cold, the flu, whatever else it is we don't want to catch, we've decided to use these twitter feeds to our advantage.

Contagious disease is one of the leading causes of death all around the world, both of humans and of other wildlife.  How can we tackle such a world wide issue?  With world wide solutions.  Twitter (and later facebook) is such a widely used product that there is a goldmine of information in these tweets.  They have geolocation information, connection information, and content information.  Using a simple machine learning script along with a webapp, we can run through these tweets and find out who is sick, where they are, where they've been, and if anyone in either of those locations have become sick.  Thus, we can create an interactive map that shows a heat map of all the sicknesses (only colds and flus for now) happening today.  With more data, this can then predict where the sicknesses may go, and with a couple of changes, can look for more deadly diseases as well.  This is a scalable solution to a vast problem that plagues are community and world today.
