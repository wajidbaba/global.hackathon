Hi, i'm Pulpo, and i am proud to present my solo team 'Octomouse'. 
Octomouse comes from octopus (me) and mouses because two friends (Pinky and The Brain) were going to join me, but they were too busy trying to conquer the world so they couldn't actually join.

It is my very first time in a hackathon! And i am very exited about the experience!

Follow my team on twitter! I'm posting updates every now and then! https://twitter.com/phk_nevermore

My name is Germán, I'm 25 years old, from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am coding since i was 14. 8 years doing that professionally.
My favorite things in the computer world are coding, hacking arround with Linux machines, and gaming to relax my mind.
I joined this hackaton because i love challenges and i want to do something fun an exciting.

About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

In my history as a software developer, i jumped across many jobs, different languages, technologies, frameworks and methodology.
My strongs are PHP, Java, Linux, and rubber duck debugging. I suck at front-end, REALLY. I don't have the patience to reload a page four hundred times to get it to look as i like.

The voice that reads very fast legal disclamers in Argentinian radio ads has inspired me to make a fine print fast-reader.
Since i've been left alone, i don't expect to get something big, but anyway i'm gonna have a fun time coding.
I don't care if i dont win, in fact, i'm sure my solution will be unfinished and totally unpolished by the end of the hackathon. 
I just hope I can share a cool idea with the world, and make somethig useful from this.

Thanks for reading, and good luck to all the teams!
