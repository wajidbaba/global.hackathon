# About This Project
TP;NS was founded in 2014 for the world's first virtual hackthon hosted by Koding.com. EULA Thingy is a Django-based web application which combines the two powerful elements of crowdsourced information and machine learning. We hope this will provide the online community with a way to quickly summarize legal resources.
