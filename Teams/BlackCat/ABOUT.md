Our team consists of 2 developers. We're working in web industry for more than 8 years, mostly remotely for our US partners. Our main goal is to get fun, test some new techologies and to sharpen our skills in new kind of tasks.
It would be great to learn something new and see other guys thoughts on the same theme as ours.
